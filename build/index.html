Major data security incidents, such as the Equifax security breach, have been widely reported on. Events such as these take place on a smaller scale almost daily, and as such, the integral role of the internet in today’s society exposes all of us to risk, especially when it comes to our bank accounts, credit cards, and our credit histories. Financial fraud is a risk not only to our present financial and personal security, but it can affect us for years to come.</p><p class="under-title under-title--last">RewardExpert drilled into the data to determine in which states your risk of becoming a victim of identity theft, credit card fraud, and related crimes is highest, and in which states you are at relatively less risk. We took into account the incidence rates of reported credit card fraud and identity theft, as well as year-over-year trends and the severity of the financial losses incurred by each event. We also took into account reports of internet-mediated incidents of fraud and identity theft, which we obtained from the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (henceforth referred to as IC3).</p></section><section class="section section--k-findings"><h2 class="section__title section__title--white">Key Findings</h2><div class="k-findings"><div class="k-findings__img-wrapper"><picture><source media="(min-width: 1850px)" srcset="images/photo/robber-1920.png, images/photo/robber-1920@2x.png 2x"><source media="(max-width: 779px)" srcset="images/photo/robber-320.png, images/photo/robber-320@2x.png 2x"><source media="(max-width: 1019px)" srcset="images/photo/robber-780.png, images/photo/robber-780@2x.png 2x"><source media="(max-width: 1439px)" srcset="images/photo/robber-1019.png, images/photo/robber-1019@2x.png 2x"><img src="images/photo/robber.png" srcset="images/photo/robber@2x.png 2x" class="k-findings__img"></picture></div><ul class="k-findings__list"><li class="k-findings__list-item"><p class="k-findings__list-item-text">From 2015 to 2016 reports of <span class="semibold">credit card fraud increased </span>nationwide by 5.15%</p></li><li class="k-findings__list-item"><p class="k-findings__list-item-text">Reports of <span class="semibold">identity theft decreased </span>significantly, by 16.05% in the same time period.</p></li><li class="k-findings__list-item"><p class="k-findings__list-item-text">Across the states, we observed <span class="semibold">absolutely no correlation </span>between per capita income and incidents of identity theft and/or credit card fraud.

Nevada is one of only six states in which reports of identity theft increased from 2015 to 2016 according to the FTC Consumer Sentinel Report. The only positive development to report in this state is that on a per-incident basis, the financial losses incurred by fraud are slightly lower than the national average.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">97.95</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">California</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">2</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">California (with Florida and Michigan) leads the nation in reports of identity theft, per the FTC Consumer Sentinel Report. Incidents in California tend to involve larger losses than the national average. The average credit card fraud incident in California incurs a $3,667 bill, and identity theft cases average $7,543.  The national average losses are $2,678 for identity theft, and $2,935 for credit card fraud. California’s higher loss figures exceed the national averages to a greater degree than the state’s average income exceeds the national average income.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">95.91</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">New Mexico</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">3</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">Continuing the geographical pattern, New Mexico is our third place “winner.” According to the FTC, credit card fraud complaints have increased by a whopping 12.73% in the course of a year. According to the FBI, the average incident costs a resident of New Mexico $3,647, which is almost the same amount as in California, and New Mexicans are on average less financially well-equipped to absorb such a loss, with an average per capita income of $45,382 to California’s $64,500.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">93.87</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Florida</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">4</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">Coming in at fourth, Florida should surprise no one: Florida has the dubious distinction of having the highest per capita rate of credit card fraud incidents as of 2016 (1,305 per 100,000 residents). This represents a significant improvement over the previous year, with a decline of 13.54% in reported credit card fraud.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">91.84</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Texas</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">5</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">Texans have been experiencing significant trouble with fraud and identity theft, with Texas coming in at fourth for complaints filed with the CFPB, fifth for reports of fraud according to the Consumer Sentinel report, and third for internet-mediated credit card fraud. Texas also takes third place in terms of the average financial losses due to fraud, with a staggeringly high price tag of $7,275 per incident. This figure may be a consequence of Texas’ relatively loose regulatory apparatus, or due to other less political causes.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">89.79</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Michigan</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">6</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">Michigan is part of a second hot-spot for fraudulent credit card activity and stolen identities. According to the most recent FTC data, Michigan has the highest rate of identity theft in the nation, affecting 175 out of every 100,000 residents, at an average cost of $2,762 per incident, according to data from the FBI. Additionally, Michigan is one of six states that saw an increase in identity theft; a 17% increase from 2015 to 2016. Credit card fraud is marginally less common and severe, however the state still ranks third overall for fraud.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">87.75</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Virginia</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">7</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">At first glance, Virginia is a geographical outlier. However, when all of the data is taken into account, its presence in our top ten makes more sense: credit card fraud and identity theft correlate with increasing population and/or the presence or proximity of a major metropolitan area, in this case, Washington, DC. There was an 8% increase in reports of fraud in the last year in Virginia, while financial losses per capita are in the 80th percentile.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">85.71</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Arizona</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">8</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">Arizona is the fifth state in the Southwestern region to make our list. This is likely due to its fast growing, diverse population, as well as an relatively high number of older residents and others particularly vulnerable to fraud and theft. Arizona’s rate of identity theft is high, in the 81st percentile according to data from the FTC, and 84th according to internet crime data from the FBI.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">83.67</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Illinois</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">9</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">Like its neighbor Michigan, Illinois has a serious identity theft problem. Illinois ranks third in the nation for identity theft, which affects 138 in 100,000 residents. Reported losses due to theft are also very high, with an average cost of $4,700 per incident. This is mitigated, however, by a significantly lower rate of credit card fraud than identity theft, at 576 per 100,000 residents, a rate that is much lower than Michigan’s 701 per 100,000 rate.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">81.63</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Washington</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">10</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">As a state with a rapidly growing population and a technology industry that is a significant engine of the state’s economy, it is not surprising that the state of Washington has one of the highest rates of credit card fraud perpetrated using the internet (8 per 100,000 residents,  with an overall incidence of 555 per 100,000).

Overall statistics from the FTC and CFPB are comparable.

Incidents, when they happen, are apparently resolved without great financial loss, as average losses reported by the IC3 ($1,716 per incident of credit card fraud, and $386 per incident of identity theft) are well below the national average for both categories.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">6.12</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">North Dakota</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">4</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">North Dakota residents have the highest average credit scores in the nation (tied with Minnesota), with Experian reporting an average score of 701. This may in part be a consequence of rare occurrence of fraud and identity theft in the state, and as such North Dakotans face fewer dings to their credit scores due to events beyond their control. North Dakota has some of the lowest rates of internet-mediated fraud and theft, and has the lowest per capita rate of financial fraud, with only 284 out of every 100,000 residents affected.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">8.16</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Maine</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">5</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">The state of Maine is a geographical anomaly in our analysis. Maine is the only state in the Northeastern region where credit card fraud and identity theft is not a major problem. Credit card fraud affects 423 per 100,000 residents (versus 547 in Massachusetts, and 463 in New Hampshire). In fact, credit card fraud incidents noted by the FTC have decreased by 5.22%, while nationally, incidents have increased by 5.15%.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">10.2</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Arkansas</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">6</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">It may come as some surprise that alongside states with relatively wealthy, financially stable populations, we find Arkansas, home to a relatively underprivileged population, at number six. Arkansas makes the list primarily on its very low rates of internet mediated financial fraud (with scores ranging from the 2nd to 10th percentile on all measures, and affecting fewer than 3 people per 100,000 residents).</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">12.24</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Nebraska</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">7</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">For number seven, we return to the peaceful, safe, and honest Great Plains to find Nebraska, yet another state in a region that appears to be a solid bloc with little fraudulent activity. Nebraska has the sixth lowest incidence rate of credit card fraud, and ninth lowest according to IC3 data. Nebraskans have a relatively high average credit score of 691, indicating either a low impact of financial fraud, or competent and comprehensive handling of incidents when they occur.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">14.28</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Wisconsin</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">8</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">It is somewhat surprising to find Wisconsin on our list of states least affected by credit card fraud and identity theft, given its proximity to a distinct hot-spot of identity theft activity in neighboring states like Illinois and Michigan. It turns out that Wisconsin has more in common with another neighboring state, Iowa. In fact, identity theft cases are down in Wisconsin by 46.88% since 2015 to an average rate of 87.5 per 100,000 residents. The rate of credit card fraud is slightly up over the same time period, but remains at a relatively low rate of 465 people per 100,000.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">16.32</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Louisiana</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">9</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">Like Arkansas, Louisiana seems like an unlikely addition to our list. However, it does appear that in some cases lower income and lower credit scores correlates with a lower risk of becoming a victim of financial fraud. Like Arkansas, internet and data-breach related incidents are rare, and when they do occur, less financial harm is done, even when Louisiana’s average income is taken into account, with an average incident of credit card fraud costing $1,551, and an incident of identity theft costing $827.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">18.37</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Hawaii</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">10</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">Finally, at tenth place, we have Hawaii.
